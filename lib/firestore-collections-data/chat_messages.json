Given the pulling to the right and the noise originating from the front left, I recommend checking the front left ball joints, tie rod ends, and wheel bearing for play.

Considering the play in the lower ball joint and the cracking in the lower control arm bushing, replacing both components on the front left would be the recommended course of action.
